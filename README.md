Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework that is widely used for web application development. It is known for its elegant syntax, tools for common tasks such as routing, authentication, and caching, and its ability to handle high traffic. Laravel follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern and includes built-in support for object-relational mapping (ORM) and query builder, making it easy to interact with databases.
